Project: AstraML Multi-Source RAG

A small, production-minded RAG system that:

Ingests three sources (docs / forums / blogs)

Applies source-specific chunking

Retrieves with per-source vector search and RRF fusion

Optionally reranks with a cross-encoder

Builds a lightweight GraphRAG layer to detect & explain contradictions

Logs sources and scores for each response
